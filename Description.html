                <h2 class="title">We are concerned about the world's largest potential group of chronic kidney
                    disease</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>According to statistics of the World Health Organization, about 1.2 million people died of kidney
                        disease in 2015
                        worldwide, which is 32% higher than that in 2005. Among them, diabetes and hypertensive patients
                        are the largest potential victims of chronic kidney disease. Of the new ESRD patients in the
                        United States in
                        the past 10
                        years, 58%
                        are from diabetes and hypertension patients. If we do not intervene in patients with early-stage
                        hypertension or
                        diabetes, it will cause a dramatic deterioration of renal function with a mortality rate up to
                        90%.
                        However,
                        if the
                        patient's kidney status can be monitored at any time, with early detection and timely medical
                        treatment,
                        up
                        to 70%
                        of the disease may be reversed. Therefore, it is of great social significance to monitor the
                        renal
                        status of
                        patients with early-stage hypertension and diabetes.</p>
                    <p>At this stage, the excretion rate of urinary microalbumin (mALB) is mainly used to diagnose
                        diabetic
                        nephropathy and
                        hypertensive nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the
                        following
                        disadvantages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and urinary tract
                            infection
                            and
                            other
                            factors can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, resulting in high misdiagnosis
                            and
                            missed
                            diagnosis.
                        </li>
                        <li>When the mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to Phase III. It is not sufficient to use this
                            indicator to
                            monitor
                            the occurrence and development of DN.
                        </li>
                        <li>Renal impairment in hypertension occurs first in the renal tubules, and then in the
                            glomerulus.
                            Urine
                            microalbumin mainly reflects glomerular filtration impairment and is not sensitive to renal
                            tubular
                            injury.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            </div>

                <h2 class="title">We use β<sub>2</sub>M for high sensitivity monitoring of the kidneys</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>In order to solve the problems in the above detection methods, we conducted a multi-study
                        investigation
                        to
                        find a new
                        type of indicator β<sub>2</sub>M which has higher sensitivity to early kidney damage.
                        β<sub>2</sub>M
                        is
                        a
                        small
                        molecule globulin produced by lymphocytes, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It can
                        be
                        freely
                        filtered
                        from the glomerulus and is absorbed by the proximal tubular in 99.9% . Under normal condition,
                        the
                        excretion
                        of
                        β<sub>2</sub>M in urine(U-β<sub>2</sub>M) is very small which is no more than 0.25mg/L.
                        U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                        excretion
                        is increased in early urine of diabetic patients with stage I hypertension and diabetes. With
                        the
                        deepening
                        of the
                        renal damage, β<sub>2</sub>M accumulates in patients and continue increase. Therefore, the
                        detection
                        of
                        U-β<sub>2</sub>M in patients with a risk of kidney disease, such as diabetes and hypertension,
                        can
                        achieve
                        real-time
                        monitoring of the condition of the kidneys, as well as the discovery of early nephropathy to
                        prevent
                        irreversible
                        damage to the kidneys.</p>

                <h2 class="title">What kind of a work we want to complete?</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>Patients with diabetes for about 5 years or those with Hypertension for 5 to 10 years are at high
                        risk of
                        chronic
                        kidney disease and are at risk of renal impairment at any time. Since diabetics and
                        hypertensives
                        are
                        usually
                        treated at home in early stages , routine blood and urine tests are rarely performed and the
                        U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                        indicator is unknown. This has led many patients to miss the opportunity for early intervention
                        and
                        control.
                        Our
                        work enables these patients to easily monitor their own renal function status at home through
                        the
                        U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                        test. In addition, we can use mobile devices to conduct a brief analysis of the patient's renal
                        function
                        and
                        give
                        medical advice.</p>

                <h2 class="title">For U-β<sub>2</sub>M we developed a suitable detection method</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>In this project, we combined strongly specific nanobodies with high-sensitivity liquid crystal
                        detection
                        to
                        develop a
                        visual detection method, thereby enabling accurate quantification or semiquantification of
                        microgram-levelU-
                        β<sub>2</sub>M. Firstly, we use nanobody to specifically bind to β<sub>2</sub>M. Compared with
                        conventional
                        antibodies, nanobody is a smaller molecular,less susceptible to denaturation, but still has
                        intact
                        antigen
                        binding
                        properties. In addition, nanobodies can be expressed by <i>E. coli</i> , which make the cost of
                        production
                        is
                        greatly reduced. What's more, we use the birefringence of liquid crystal molecules. The liquid
                        crystal
                        application
                        that we are familiar with is liquid crystal display, but this is to change the arrangement of
                        the
                        liquid
                        crystal
                        molecules through the electric current, thus show different light signals. Here, we modify the
                        liquid
                        crystal cell
                        substrate with antibodies. After combining antigens, the micro-environment of the liquid crystal
                        cell
                        platform
                        changes, resulting in a significant difference in color or brightness , the visualization of
                        detection
                        is
                        achieved.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project will propose a low-cost, portable and visible method for monitoring early renal
                        injury
                        and
                        provide
