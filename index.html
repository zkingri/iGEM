<h3>项目描述</h3>
<h4>We are concerned about the world's largest potential group of chronic kidney disease.</h4>
<p>According to statistics of the World Health Organization, about 1.2 million people died of kidney disease in 2015
    worldwide, which is 32% higher than that in 2005. Among them, diabetes and hypertensive patients are the largest
    potential victims of chronic kidney disease. Of the new ESRD patients in the United States in the past 10 years, 58%
    are from diabetes and hypertension patients. If we do not intervene in patients with early-stage hypertension or
    diabetes, it will cause a dramatic deterioration of renal function with a mortality rate up to 90%. However, if the
    patient's kidney status can be monitored at any time, with early detection and timely medical treatment, up to 70%
    of the disease may be reversed. Therefore, it is of great social significance to monitor the renal status of
    patients with early-stage hypertension and diabetes.</p>
<p>At this stage, the excretion rate of urinary microalbumin (mALB) is mainly used to diagnose diabetic nephropathy and
    hypertensive nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the following
    disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and urinary tract infection and other
        factors can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, resulting in high misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
    </li>
    <li>When the mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to Phase III. It is not sufficient to use this indicator to monitor
        the occurrence and development of DN.
    </li>
    <li>Renal impairment in hypertension occurs first in the renal tubules, and then in the glomerulus. Urine
        microalbumin mainly reflects glomerular filtration impairment and is not sensitive to renal tubular injury.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>We use β<sub>2</sub>M for high sensitivity monitoring of the kidneys.</h4>
<p>In order to solve the problems in the above detection methods, we conducted a multi-study investigation to find a new
    type of indicator β<sub>2</sub>M which has higher sensitivity to early kidney damage. β<sub>2</sub>M is a small
    molecule globulin produced by lymphocytes, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It can be freely filtered
    from the glomerulus and is absorbed by the proximal tubular in 99.9% . Under normal condition, the excretion of
    β<sub>2</sub>M in urine(U-β<sub>2</sub>M) is very small which is no more than 0.25mg/L. U-β<sub>2</sub>M excretion
    is increased in early urine of diabetic patients with stage I hypertension and diabetes. With the deepening of the
    renal damage, β<sub>2</sub>M accumulates in patients and continue increase. Therefore, the detection of
    U-β<sub>2</sub>M in patients with a risk of kidney disease, such as diabetes and hypertension, can achieve real-time
    monitoring of the condition of the kidneys, as well as the discovery of early nephropathy to prevent irreversible
    damage to the kidneys.</p>
<h4>What kind of a work we want to complete?</h4>
<p>Patients with diabetes for about 5 years or those with Hypertension for 5 to 10 years are at high risk of chronic
    kidney disease and are at risk of renal impairment at any time. Since diabetics and hypertensives are usually
    treated at home in early stages , routine blood and urine tests are rarely performed and the U-β<sub>2</sub>M
    indicator is unknown. This has led many patients to miss the opportunity for early intervention and control. Our
    work enables these patients to easily monitor their own renal function status at home through the U-β<sub>2</sub>M
    test. In addition, we can use mobile devices to conduct a brief analysis of the patient's renal function and give
    medical advice.</p>
<h4>For U-β<sub>2</sub>M we developed a suitable detection method</h4>
<p>In this project, we combined strongly specific nanobodies with high-sensitivity liquid crystal detection to develop a
    visual detection method, thereby enabling accurate quantification or semiquantification of microgram-levelU-
    β<sub>2</sub>M. Firstly, we use nanobody to specifically bind to β<sub>2</sub>M. Compared with conventional
    antibodies, nanobody is a smaller molecular,less susceptible to denaturation, but still has intact antigen binding
    properties. In addition, nanobodies can be expressed by <i>E. coli</i> , which make the cost of production is
    greatly reduced. What's more, we use the birefringence of liquid crystal molecules. The liquid crystal application
    that we are familiar with is liquid crystal display, but this is to change the arrangement of the liquid crystal
    molecules through the electric current, thus show different light signals. Here, we modify the liquid crystal cell
    substrate with antibodies. After combining antigens, the micro-environment of the liquid crystal cell platform
    changes, resulting in a significant difference in color or brightness , the visualization of detection is achieved.
</p>
<p>This project will propose a low-cost, portable and visible method for monitoring early renal injury and provide
    medical advice for patients with hypertension and diabetes.
