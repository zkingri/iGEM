        <h2 class="title">We are concerned about the world's largest potential group of chronic kidney disease</h2>
        <div class="mainText">
            <p>According to statistics of the World Health Organization, about 1.2 million people died of kidney disease in
                2015
                worldwide, which is 32% higher than that in 2005. Among them, diabetes and hypertensive patients are the
                largest
                potential victims of chronic kidney disease. Of the new ESRD patients in the United States in the past 10
                years, 58%
                are from diabetes and hypertension patients. If we do not intervene in patients with early-stage
                hypertension or
                diabetes, it will cause a dramatic deterioration of renal function with a mortality rate up to 90%. However,
                if the
                patient's kidney status can be monitored at any time, with early detection and timely medical treatment, up
                to 70%
                of the disease may be reversed. Therefore, it is of great social significance to monitor the renal status of
                patients with early-stage hypertension and diabetes.</p>
            <p>At this stage, the excretion rate of urinary microalbumin (mALB) is mainly used to diagnose diabetic
                nephropathy and
                hypertensive nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the following
                disadvantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and urinary tract infection and
                    other
                    factors can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, resulting in high misdiagnosis and missed
                    diagnosis.
                </li>
                <li>When the mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to Phase III. It is not sufficient to use this indicator to
                    monitor
                    the occurrence and development of DN.
                </li>
                <li>Renal impairment in hypertension occurs first in the renal tubules, and then in the glomerulus. Urine
                    microalbumin mainly reflects glomerular filtration impairment and is not sensitive to renal tubular
                    injury.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="title">We use β<sub>2</sub>M for high sensitivity monitoring of the kidneys</h2>
        <div class="mainText">
            <p>In order to solve the problems in the above detection methods, we conducted a multi-study investigation to
                find a new
                type of indicator β<sub>2</sub>M which has higher sensitivity to early kidney damage. β<sub>2</sub>M is a
                small
                molecule globulin produced by lymphocytes, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It can be freely
                filtered
                from the glomerulus and is absorbed by the proximal tubular in 99.9% . Under normal condition, the excretion
                of
                β<sub>2</sub>M in urine(U-β<sub>2</sub>M) is very small which is no more than 0.25mg/L. U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                excretion
                is increased in early urine of diabetic patients with stage I hypertension and diabetes. With the deepening
                of the
                renal damage, β<sub>2</sub>M accumulates in patients and continue increase. Therefore, the detection of
                U-β<sub>2</sub>M in patients with a risk of kidney disease, such as diabetes and hypertension, can achieve
                real-time
                monitoring of the condition of the kidneys, as well as the discovery of early nephropathy to prevent
                irreversible
                damage to the kidneys.</p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="title">What kind of a work we want to complete?</h2>
        <div class="mainText">
            <p>Patients with diabetes for about 5 years or those with Hypertension for 5 to 10 years are at high risk of
                chronic
                kidney disease and are at risk of renal impairment at any time. Since diabetics and hypertensives are
                usually
                treated at home in early stages , routine blood and urine tests are rarely performed and the U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                indicator is unknown. This has led many patients to miss the opportunity for early intervention and control.
                Our
                work enables these patients to easily monitor their own renal function status at home through the
                U-β<sub>2</sub>M
                test. In addition, we can use mobile devices to conduct a brief analysis of the patient's renal function and
                give
                medical advice.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="fixed4"></div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="title">For U-β<sub>2</sub>M we developed a suitable detection method</h2>
        <div class="mainText">
            <p>In this project, we combined strongly specific nanobodies with high-sensitivity liquid crystal detection to
                develop a
                visual detection method, thereby enabling accurate quantification or semiquantification of microgram-levelU-
                β<sub>2</sub>M. Firstly, we use nanobody to specifically bind to β<sub>2</sub>M. Compared with conventional
                antibodies, nanobody is a smaller molecular,less susceptible to denaturation, but still has intact antigen
                binding
                properties. In addition, nanobodies can be expressed by <i>E. coli</i> , which make the cost of production
                is
                greatly reduced. What's more, we use the birefringence of liquid crystal molecules. The liquid crystal
                application
                that we are familiar with is liquid crystal display, but this is to change the arrangement of the liquid
                crystal
                molecules through the electric current, thus show different light signals. Here, we modify the liquid
                crystal cell
                substrate with antibodies. After combining antigens, the micro-environment of the liquid crystal cell
                platform
                changes, resulting in a significant difference in color or brightness , the visualization of detection is
                achieved.
            </p>
            <p>This project will propose a low-cost, portable and visible method for monitoring early renal injury and
                provide
                medical advice for patients with hypertension and diabetes.
