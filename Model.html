                    substance concentration</sub></h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>We have established a grayscale model to describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody
                        immobilization and detection, and to digitize the results into accurate numbers. This model can
                        guide us to more accurately determine the relationship between the reaction results and our
                        effects in three phases. Especially in the detection, the concentration of the analyte can be
                        embodied and digitized, thus giving us a better and specific detection limit.</p>
                    <p>For the gray value calculation of a resulting image, we first grayscale it. In order to calculate
                        the gray value of the color picture, we have grayed out with MATLAB. At the same time, in order
                        to give a clear grayscale picture, we performed image equalization and gave a balanced
                        picture<sup>[Attachment 1]</sup>. After obtaining the grayscale image, we use the formula (1) to
                        calculate the grayscale of the image. In order to obtain accurate data more conveniently, we use
                        the programming language to design a small software <sup>[Attachment 2]</sup>, which can
                        calculate the average grayscale of the image. There is an error in the data for the no grayscale
                        picture. According to our experimental results, it is about 5% when the gray value is not too
                        low. Compared with the equalized grayscale image, the error is about 10%.</p>
                    <p>$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$</p>
                    <p>For the experimental results, we can understand whether it is fixed antigen, immobilized antibody
                        or detection. In the initial stage, the gray value is positively correlated with the
                        concentration of the additive; and as the concentration of the additive increases, the gray
                        value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy these properties,
                        namely equation (2) and formula (3):</p>
                    <p>Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$</p>
                    <p>Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$</p>
                    <p>We substituting the above two formulas into the literature we examined<sup>[2]</sup>, where model
                        (2) is in
                        good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate
                        is analogous to our addition. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate-substrate concentration and
                        gray value-addition concentration have a good fit. So we decided to use this model. And in the
                        other literature<sup>[1]</sup> of the model, the results obtained are also consistent. The gray
                        value and
                        concentration relationship in this model are shown in Fig. 1(a), This applies to both fixed
                        antigens, immobilized antibodies and assays. The different added substances are shown in
                        Fig. 2(b).</p>

                    <p>In the step of immobilizing the antigen, we control the amount of antigen added, the fixed time,
                        and the brightness and the observation magnification at the time of sampling, and use a large
                        amount of experimental data to average and reduce the error. Experimental Results After data
                        processing, the Figures 1(c), Equations \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image
                        was used to
                        predict other data and found good agreement. Explain that the gray value-concentration model we
                        built is in line with our experiments. Thus, we further established the model on antibody
                        immobilization and obtained the results of equations \(\mathrm{Z_1}\). From the model and our
                        experimental
                        data, it can be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively
                        correlated when the concentration is not large. From the model and our experimental data, it can
                        be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively correlated when the
                        concentration is not very large and more than 0.4 μg/ml.</p>
                    <p>$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$</p>
                    <p>$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$</p>
                    <p>There is a bias when the antigen is not fixed. Therefore, we perform a statistical average of the
                        gray values of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is the result of correcting
                        the zero
                        point deviation and the post-processing of the comparison relation \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).
                        \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be obtained
                        by treating the modified antibody model in the same manner.

                    time</sub></h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, we did the relationship between the remaining
                        antigen concentration and time when the antigen was immobilized.</p>
                    <p>In our step of fixing the antigen concentration, we can get the reaction formula
                        \(\mathrm{\alpha}\) and give the
                        pattern diagram ω<sub>1</sub>, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the reaction site
                        concentration
                        on the
                        slide. Since the addition liquid fixation and treatment methods are unchanged, \(M_0\) does not
                        change.</p>
                    <p>$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$</p>
                    <div class="img"><img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ae/T--DLUT_China_B--Model1.png"></div>
                    <p>If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen
                        accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics
                        relationship, we can list the relationship:</p>
                    <p>$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$</p>
                    <p>If we determine a \(\theta\), that is, we want the percentage of the fixed position on the slide,
                        generally the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid crystal. It is
                        given by our experimental data that \(\theta\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let
                        \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), we can get the relationship:</p>
                    <p>$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$</p>
                    <p>In this way we can get the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen
                        and the reaction time (4):</p>
                    <p>$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$</p>
                    <p>Thus, from the relationship we can predict the relationship between the residual antigen
                        concentration and time, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).</p>

                    <p>It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped by 90% or 80% of the reaction, because it is
                        uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen concentration
                        change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is small, the
                        reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the different

                    <p>The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and
                        predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial
                        domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and
                        interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density
                        threshold can be calculated by this model.</p>
                    <h3 class="title">Purpose</h3>
                    <p>An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen
                        concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β<sub>2</sub>-M density
                        microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can
                        perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two
                        models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and
                        finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our
                        experimental results.</p>
