                            the

                        <ul>
                            <li>23 Aug: Antibody concentration 125ng/ml. Antibody concentration 2000ng/ml.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since the preliminary experiment for exploring the appropriate antibody concentration did not
                            find a critical value of the antibody concentration that can change the alignment of the
                            liquid
                            crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL
                            does
                            not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research.
                            It
                            is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial
                            antibody
                            concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β<sub>2</sub>-MG) in
                            the urine of our
                            current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to
                            determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the
                            concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be
                            aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid
                            crystals in parallel.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for
                            experiments. The number of bright spots in 0.125 ng/mL-2 ng/mL parallel light images
                            increased
                            accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough
                            (Figure
                            3). Not enough to determine the standard line of detection. (Note: due to 1000 ng/mL data

                        <ul>
                            <li>25 Aug: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since the previous experiments used high antibody concentration or high antigen
                            concentration,
                            the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We
                            reflect on
                            whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the
                            experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid
                            crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the
                            failure
                            to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP
                            concentration,
                            and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different,
                            and
                            the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to
                            0.2%
                            concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is
                            significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of
                            bright
                            spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1%
                            concentration.</p>

                        <p>Following the last experiment, we thought that 500 ng/mL antigen fixation is currently
                            reasonable. So we did the effect of antibody concentration of 1000 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL at
                            an
                            antigen concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figure (6) a, b), where we will self-assemble the upper
                            and
                            lower slides. And considering the damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the

                            of the slide, the slide was dried at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the
                            same
                            time, the antigen fixation process still adopts the method of soaking. Three sets of

                            ng / ml (Figure (6) c). However, the method of soaking the immobilized antigen was not
                            adopted,

                <p>We continued to train the cells, but the OD600 has been low, so we discussed the reasons for the

                    <p>(1) Today, We did the colony PCR and agarose gel. The methods are at the Protocols. But our retules
                        was not good. We thought that was because we were’t boiled the cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>(2) We picked up a single colony inoculation from the plate into 5 mL LB liquid medium (with

                    </p>
                    <p>(2) At 18:00, add CuSO4 and Ara to 15mL medium (50μM/L for CuSO4 and 0.2% for Ara, 18℃, 220 rpm for

                    </p>
                    <p>(2) Repeated the steps of Sept. 24.</p>
                
                <p>Oct. 6</p>
                <p>We found that the E.coli BL21 was failed so we want to extracted plasmids from E.coli DH-5α.</p>

                <p>Oct. 7</p>
                <p>Today, we did the plasmids extraction and agarose gel. But the result was not well. So we wanted to

                <p>Picking up a single colony inoculation into 100 mL LB liquid medium (with antibiotic). 37℃, 220 rpm
                    for 16 hours. Than we did the Bacteria Preservation and expanded cultures.</p>
                <p>Oct. 12</p>
                <p>pipetted 500 μL cultures to 50 mL new LB liquid medium (with antibiotic). 37℃, 220 rpm for
                    4-5hours.</p>
                
                    <p>(1) Measured OD600.</p>
                    <p>(2) We repeated the steps of Oct. 4 (2).</p>
                
                <p>Oct. 13</p>
                
                    <p>(1) Repeated the steps of 10.5(1). Take the supernatant and make it pH=4， Centrifuged again. Take
                        100μL supernatant to a tube and add 5μL fluorescent dye to it. Wrpa the tube with tin foil 37℃
                        for 6 hours. Resuspending the sample with PBS for the above precipitation.
                    </p>
                    <p>(2) Add 50 mM C18 acylhdrazine to 5 mL DMSO. Add 100μL the mixture to 1 mL supernatant. for two
                        tubes. One at 37℃ for 3 hours. Another at 20℃ for 3 hours.
                    </p>
                
                <p>Oct. 14</p>
                <p>We did the SDS-PAGE. The order as follow:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fluorescent dye modification</li>
                    <li>2.C18 acylhdrazine modification for 37 ℃</li>
                    <li>C18 acylhdrazine modification for 20 ℃</li>
                    <li>Acidified supernatant</li>
                    <li>Maker</li>
                    <li>Maker</li>
                    <li>Broken supernatant</li>
                    <li>Post-crushing precipitation</li>
                    <li>Induced bacterial solution</li>
                    <li>Inductive bacteria solution</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The result was as follow.</p>
