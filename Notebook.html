                        carried out an experiment to determine the appropriate concentration of the antibody, and we
                        selected 50 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 2000 ng/mL antibody respectively. The concentration
                        was tested and three parallel experimental groups were set for each concentration. Parallel
                        light and conical light were used for observation. The parallel light observation results (Fig.
                        1) were all black, indicating that the liquid crystal remained vertical.</p>

                        results of parallel light. Parallel light observations still show all black, and cross-contrast
                        observations have crosshairs. It is indicated that the liquid crystals are still mostly arranged
                        vertically. The critical concentration for changing the liquid crystal from the vertical

                        concentration of 10 ng/mL or less did not cause a change in the color of the liquid crystal.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the preliminary experiment for exploring the appropriate antibody concentration did not
                        find a critical value of the antibody concentration that can change the alignment of the liquid
                        crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL does
                        not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research. It
                        is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial antibody
                        concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β2-MG) in the urine of our
                        current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to
                        determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the
                        concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be
                        aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid
                        crystals in parallel.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for
                        experiments. The number of bright spots in 0.125 ng/mL-2 ng/mL parallel light images increased
                        accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough (Figure
                        3). Not enough to determine the standard line of detection. (Note: due to 1000 ng/mL data file
                        corruption, not shown in the figure)</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the previous experiments used high antibody concentration or high antigen concentration,
                        the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We reflect on
                        whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the
                        experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid
                        crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the failure
                        to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP concentration,
                        and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different, and
                        the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to 0.2%
                        concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is
                        significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of bright
                        spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1% concentration.</p>

                        of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the antigen
                        was immobilized, and reacted at 37℃ for 1 h. Rinse with 0.01 mol/L PBS buffer (pH=7.4) and
                        deionized water to remove non-specific adsorbed substances, and dried with N<sub>2</sub>. A liquid crystal
                        cell was prepared according to the method (4), and a change in color and brightness of the
                        liquid crystal film was observed using a polarizing microscope and image analysis was

                    <p>We investigated the effect of antigens of different concentrations on the vertical alignment of
                        liquid crystals without antibodies. The methods of antigen-antibody immobilization on glass were
                        collected from the literature of silkworm (crosslinked glutaraldehyde).The antigen was dissolved
                        in 0.01 mol/L of PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) and configured to have
                        0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.3mg/L, 0.4mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 2mg/L and 4mg/L of the antigen solution to have
                        experiments with 1% DMOAP. For details of subsequent treatment, please refer to the third step of

                        differences among 0.5mg/L-4mg/L. It suggested that the molecular weight of antigen may be too
                        small to affect the vertical alignment of liquid crystal. Therefore, the effect of antigens of
                        0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good.</p>

                        nanobody concentration. An appropriate amount of 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L and 0.5mg/L concentration
                        of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the antigen

                        <li>15 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen
                            concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1500 ng/ml.

                    </ul>
                    <p>Following the last experiment, we thought that 500 ng/mL antigen fixation is currently
                        reasonable. So we did the effect of antibody concentration of 1000 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL at an
                        antigen concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figure (6) a, b), where we will self-assemble the upper and
                        lower slides. And considering the damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the self-assembly
                        of the slide, the slide was dried at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the same
                        time, the antigen fixation process still adopts the method of soaking. Three sets of parallel
                        experiments were performed separately.</p>
                    <p>Then we also made a set of antigen concentration of 500 ng / ml, antibody concentration of 1500
                        ng / ml (Figure (6) c). However, the method of soaking the immobilized antigen was not adopted,
                        but the previous dropping method was employed.</p>
