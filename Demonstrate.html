                    <p>In order to fulfill the requirements of testing diseases at home for patients instead of going to
                        hospital tested by high-tech testing equipment. We designed our products which can upload
                        grayscale data to the cloud and analyze it through mobile devices obviously. What we required is
                        just a liquid crystal detection scheme, which is sufficient to reflect the change in
                        β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        concentration.</p>
                    <p>The main purpose of our experiment is to prove whether the change in β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        concentration in the
                        home test box (Dr. Familict) can be reflected in the liquid crystal through a noticeable gray
                        scale change. Therefore, we have constructed a molecule that is more suitable for the liquid
                        crystal detection system based on the nano-antibody, a competitive combination which can disturb
                        the liquid crystal to change the gray level of the image.</p>
                    <p>We designed a competitive binding method : First, immobilizing a certain amount of β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        in a
                        liquid crystal, and then combining the test solution with an excess of Nanobody. The mixture is
                        then added to the liquid crystal, and due to the excess of the Nanobody, the excess is bound to
                        the immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG, causing perturbation of the liquid crystal. Since the fixed
                        β<sub>2</sub>-MG is a
                        certain amount, the amount of β<sub>2</sub>-MG in the liquid to be tested can be calculated by
                        the
                        difference method. However, during the experiment, we found that the nano-antibody itself has
                        little disturbance to the liquid crystal, so we hope to construct a more interfering molecule
                        based on the nano-antibody. At the same time, we tested the effects of different β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        and
                        nanobody concentrations on liquid crystal perturbations, and hope to find a set of solutions
                        with the most obvious gray scale changes.</p>

                    <p>Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts: molecular biology experiments and liquid
                        crystal experiments. </p>
                    <p>We obtained nano-antibodies with aldehyde groups by adding aldehyde-based labels to
                        nano-antibodies and by FGE treatment. After that, we added C18 to the Nanobody to enhance its
                        interference. Finally, we verified that the interference of the antigen concentration on the
                        liquid crystal can be detected.</p>
                    <p>In the molecular biology sector, we planned to connect a long-chain molecule (C18) on the
                        nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, pET28a and pBAD. The first plasmid pET28a contains a
                        nanobody and a gene with an aldehyde-based catalytic substrate tag. The second plasmid, pBAD,
                        contains the FGE (Formylglycine-generating enzyme) gene. Then we changed the conversion plan
                        several times due to poor conversion efficiency, and finally got a satisfactory conversion
                        rate.</p>
                    <p>We wanted to see that the substrate tag can be finally expressed at the inactive end of the
                        nanobody in E. coli BL21, and has little effect on the conformation of the nanobody. In the
                        cell, the substrate tag was converted to an aldehyde group by FGE treatment. Subsequently, after
                        the transformation of aldehyde-based nanobody, we disrupted the cells by sonication and purified
                        the disrupted cell suspension to obtain the nanobody we needed. Next step, we combined the
                        Nanobody with C18. We have obtained a better experimental protocol by changing the
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier. Firstly, we modified the slides
                        with DMOAP which can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state
                        of the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black. Meanwhile, we modified the slides with
                        APTES so that they can be attached to the β<sub>2</sub>-MG; Then we added β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        nanobody to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and the
                        liquid crystals were added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under
                        the microscope to judge the β<sub>2</sub>–MG of the detected sample concentration.</p>

                        <p>We designed a liquid crystal cell as an observation supporter. First, the upper glass slide
                            was modified with 0.2%DMOAP to induce the vertical alignment of the liquid crystals and make
                            the optical imaging of liquid crystals appear black at the first time.Meanwhile, we modified

                            that it could connect to the target protein. Then We mixed the sample with the antibody and
                            added it to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and then
                            the liquid crystals were added. We could observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystals

                        <p>1. Standard for immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG concentration</p>
                        <p>We have known that the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is very sensitive to the
                            topographic changes on the substrate surface. When the β<sub>2</sub>-MG and GA are
                            crosslinked and fixed on the substrate surface, the topographic structure of the surface
                            will be changed to a certain extent affecting the orientation of the liquid crystal
                            molecules. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the concentration of
                            immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG on the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell. With the
                            decrease of the concentration of immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG, the perturbation to the
                            orientation of liquid crystal molecule decreases, and the optical imaging of liquid crystal
                            cell gradually darkens. Only a few speckles appear in the optical imaging of liquid crystal
                            cell, which tend to be all-black background. The highest immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                            concentration, which can keep the optical imaging background dark, is fixed on the substrate
                            surface when sufficient antigen and antibody reactions are required. </p>

                        <p>Keeping other conditions unchanged,the concerntration of β<sub>2</sub>-MG is in the range of 250ng/mL to 1000ng/mL,

                            other conditions unchanged. Therefore, we can determine the change trend of the brightness

                            The relationship between the luminance of liquid crystal and the concentration of

                        <p> The influence of the concentration of the nano-antibody on the optical imaging of the liquid
                            crystal cell was further investigated. If we don’t add β<sub>2</sub>-MG in the sample, there
                            will has color spots in the polarizing microscope imaging. When the concentration of the
                            nano-antibody in the sample was low, only a few bright spots approached the full black
                            background. In the subsequent detection, the substrate immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG will
                            compete with the tested sample β<sub>2</sub>-MG to bind the limited reaction sites on the
                            β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibody. When the concentration of the tested β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                            approaches zero (detection limit is infinitely low), the β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibody will
                            combine with the substrate immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG to disturb the orientation of the
                            liquid crystal molecule to the maximum extent, resulting in the optical imaging of the
                            liquid crystal cell. With the increase of the concentration of β<sub>2</sub>-MG, the binding
                            of β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibody to the substrate immobilized β<sub>2</sub>-MG decreases,
                            and the optical imaging becomes dark from, thus completing the detection of β<sub>2</sub>-MG.

                        <p>Through the experimental results, we could find that as the concentration of antibody
                            increased , the crystal molecular orientation is getting more messy, and the bright spots
                            gradually enhance in the optical imaging. However, 400ng/mL is the threshold of the
                            concentration of β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibodies. When the concentration of nano-antibodies
                            increases again, the bright spots in the liquid crystal imaging did not enhance
                            significantly. Therefore, the lowest antibody concentration at 400ng/mL was selected for the
                            immobilization of β<sub>2</sub>-MG on the substrate surface, which could maintain the
                            maximum bright spots in the optical imaging background.</p>

                        <p>From the experimental results, we can find that the C18 modified β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                            nano-antibody has greater disturbance to the liquid crystal molecules, so we can judge that
                            the sensitivity of the C18 modified β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibody is higher.</p>

                    <div class="mainText">
                        <p>Through experiments, we finally decided to immobilize 500ng/mL β<sub>2</sub>-MG on the
                            substrate , binding with 400ng/mL β<sub>2</sub>-MG nano-antibody. In addition, we determined
                            that the detection sensitivity of the antibody at β<sub>2</sub>-MG modified by C18 was
                            higher. Therefore, we can detect the concentration of β<sub>2</sub>-MG in the range of
                            100ng/ ml-400ng /mL (a theoretical estimate) by this method, which meets our requirements
                            for the early diagnosis of nephropathy patients.</p>
                        <p>Through a series of Confirmatory experiment, we have proved that in the early stage of
                            chronic
                            kidney disease, our detection system can indeed reflect the changes in β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                            concentration,
                            which can remind users to go to the hospital for further testing.</p>
                        <p>In the future, we plan to establish a more complete back-office system, which can directly
                            obtain more accurate test results based on the user's past physical indicators.</p>
