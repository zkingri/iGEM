                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>According to the 2017 report of the International Diabetes Federation, there are 425 million
                        people with diabetes in the world; in China, the number of people with diabetes is about 110
                        million, and the number of people with hypertension is about 230 million. The patient population
                        is extremely large. This type of population is the main patient group of hidden chronic kidney
                        disease. If chronic kidney disease cannot be detected and treated early, it may eventually lead
                        to uremia, with a mortality rate of up to 90%, and timely early diagnosis may bring about 70%
                        reversal rate. Therefore, early screening for chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes
                        and hypertension is of great significance.</p>
                    <p>The incidence of chronic kidney disease can be divided into five stages. The symptoms of patients in stage I and stage II are not obvious. By the third stage, the patient showed more obvious symptoms, and at this time, the kidneys had suffered more serious damage. Due to the concealment of chronic kidney disease in the first and second stages, many patients cannot go to the hospital for medical examination in time. When the patients with chronic kidney disease have reached the third stage of chronic kidney disease, the treatment effect will be far less than the first and second stages. In addition, going to the hospital for physical examination is also inconvenient, which also makes some patients unable to consciously go to the hospital for physical examination. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a portable tool for early detection of chronic kidney disease, to help potential patients with chronic kidney disease such as diabetes and hypertension to detect their physical condition at home in real time, and to provide early warning for the development of the first and second stages of chronic kidney disease.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Principle of Design</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>We selected β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>-MG) as an indicator of early detection of
                        chronic kidney disease, because β<sub>2</sub>-MG has an abnormally elevated concentration in the
                        first and second stages of development of chronic kidney disease (for detailed information of
                        β<sub>2</sub>-MG please refer to our project section). We designed a visualized liquid crystal
                        urine protein detector Dr. Familict whose detection principle is based on our liquid crystal
                        detection experiment. In Dr. Familict, the liquid crystals are vertically aligned under the
                        action of the DMOAP inducer, and the polarized light incident on the polarizing plate thereon
                        passes through the liquid crystal to make the image inside the box black; when there is an
                        excessive amount of β<sub>2</sub>-MG in the urine it reacts with the immobilized nanoantibodies
                        on the glass slide. The larger antigen-antibody complexes generated will disturb the
                        distribution of the liquid crystal molecules so that they are no longer vertically aligned, and
                        the transmitted polarized light passes through the disorder. The aligned liquid crystal
                        molecules turn into color, reflecting the presence of excess β<sub>2</sub>-MG in the urine,
                        which provides early warning of the development of chronic kidney disease.</p>

                <div class="mainText">
                    <p>Our products are presented in kit form, without the need for expert knowledge, and can be tested
                        by following the instructions. This kit can be used both at home and in the hospital, and is
                        portable and easy to operate. The test results of this kit provide early warning only for the
                        occurrence of chronic kidney disease, warning patients of the risk of chronic kidney disease,

                        crystal cell is filled with vertically aligned liquid crystal. When used, the urine drop to be
                        tested is first added to the glass slide and then the glass slide is assembled with the liquid
                        crystal cell, and the complex formed by antigen-antibody combination can affect the liquid
                        crystal alignment and produce corresponding image color change.</p>
                    <p><b>Steps for Usage:</b></p>
                    <p>Step 1: Take your own urine (a drop) and drop it onto a glass slide and leave it at room
                        temperature for 40 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Step 2: Rinse the glass slide with water and blow dry with a fan or blower.</p>
                    <p>Step 3: The glass slide is placed on the liquid crystal cell to complete the assembly of the test
                        chip.</p>
                    <p>Step 4: Insert the test chip into the middle of the kit.</p>
                    <p>Step 5: Use ordinary light (the light of the mobile phone) to illuminate the polarizer above the
                        kit. If you can see the color of the light indicating that there is excessive β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        in the
                        urine, the patient should go to the hospital for further physical examination. Only black images
                        or sporadic bright spots can be seen, indicating that the patient is in good health.</p>
                    <p>Step 6: After taking the observed image with a mobile phone, use our own software to process the
                        image, and you can get the grayscale analysis result of the image and the current β<sub>2</sub>-MG
                        content
                        in the urine.</p>
                    <p>Step 7: Just replace the disposable piece of glass when you need to use it again.</p>
                    <p><b>Precautions:</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>After the urine is added, the glass slide should be placed for at least 40 minutes;</li>
                        <li>When using a hair dryer to dry the glass slide, use a cold wind file, and pay attention that
                            the wind cannot be too large.

                    <h3 class="title">The Second Generation of Dr. Familict</h3>
                    <p><b>Structure:</b></p>
                    <p>In order to further improve the user-friendliness of the products and enable patients to obtain a
                        more convenient product experience, we proposed an improved version of the product design based
                        on the first-generation product design. The operation of the second generation of Dr. Familict
                        kit is semi-automated and its size is 20 cm &times; 20 cm &times; 10 cm. It consists mainly of a
                        slide slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste collector, a liquid crystal cell, a polarizer and an
                        analyzer. The antigen-antibody reaction is still carried out on the slide, and the slide is
                        moved to the slide position by sliding positioning. Different reaction chambers are used to
                        complete the operations of dropping antibody, dropping liquid crystal, rinsing, and image
                        observation, etc.</p>
                    <p><b>Steps for Usage:</b></p>
                    <p>Step 1: Insert the antigen-coated glass slide into the slide slot, and the kit system
                        automatically drops a drop of the antibody solution.</p>
                    <p>Step 2: The user drops a drop of urine in the test area and presses the button on the kit to
                        start timing. Subsequent operations will be done automatically by the system.</p>
                    <p>Step 3: The system timed reaction 40 minutes after the slide is moved to the washing buffer
                        chamber for 30 seconds of rinsing and drying, after the slide moved to the detection area, the
                        system drops the liquid crystal and turns on the bottom light, ordinary light passes the
                        polarizer produces polarized light and produces a color change in the liquid crystal region.</p>
                    <p>Step 4: The user takes a picture of the detected image and uploads it to the APP to obtain the
                        image gray scale data and the β<sub>2</sub>-MG concentration in the urine, and the corresponding
                        medical advice.</p>
                    <p><b>Precautions:</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The antigen layer glass slide will automatically drop the antibody solution only when it is
                            inserted into the correct position in the groove;
                        </li>
                        <li>When the crystal liquid is added and when you can observe and take pictures, the system will
                            make a sound to remind you so you don't have to wait at the kit.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Customer Feedback</b></p>
                    <p>Although we have implemented the semi-automated operation of the second-generation of Dr.
                        Familict design and reduced the user's operation steps, we still hope that you can provide
                        constructive and valuable advice for our products, including but not limited to your hope of
                        better operation process, results presentation, reaction time, and data analysis software. We
                        will further improve user interface based on your feedback on our product design.</p>
